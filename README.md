Omg, just finished watching iHostage and like... what did I just experience? ðŸ˜‚ For real, itâ€™s like they crushed every action movie clichÃ© into this wild ride of nonsense. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was hella entertaining, but also, where was the logic? 

> Seriously, the lead dude was dodging bullets like he was in some Matrix sequel we didn't know about. And letâ€™s not even talk about his invincible phone. Like, bro, that thing survived more explosions than I have meals in a week. ðŸŽ¬ 

And there was this random plot twist with the hacker friend that came out of nowhere, and it was like, Oh, surprise! I'm actually a super genius! Wow, who would've seen that one coming. But hey, I'm not complaining, it kinda worked. Or did it? I'm not so sure anymore.

Anyway, the villain was classic good guy gone bad, nothing new, but somehow the actor sold it. Like, props to him for looking menacing while holding a grudge about some backstory they explained in like three lines. ðŸ˜‚ I just couldnâ€™t take it seriously after a point. Maybe I was just tired. Or maybe this movie doesn't know what subtlety means?

> Oh oh, and I guess it kinda hit home how sometimes you just need to download the movie instead of waiting for ages. So glad I did that this time. Life's too short to miss out on such ridiculousness.

But man, the special effects though, they really went all out. Flashy as hell, like look at all our budget! Kept me awake, so there's that. I watched the movie expecting nothing and somehow got exactly that, lol. You understand what I mean?

def what_even_is_this_code():
    return seriously no idea ðŸ¤·

The end was a mess, but entertaining messes are still fun, you know? So, anyway, I guess if youâ€™re in the mood for a crazy and kinda nonsensical watch, iHostage's your jam. Or just wait for better stuff to pop up. What even is good cinema anymore, right?
